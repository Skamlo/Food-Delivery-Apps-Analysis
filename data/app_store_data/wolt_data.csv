However, on the multiple occasions that something went wrong with my order or i just wanted to cancel an existing one, wolt has provided me with the most abhorrent online customer service i’ve received in a long time. there is no way to cancel orders in the app. you have to contact a “customer service assistant” through Wolt’s live chat feature, which is already a completely unecessary hurdle of its own. By the time i get a reply (usually 10+ minutes) the restaurant is already making my food, so the order can’t be cancelled. since this is probably outsourced through some live support platform i can’t really blame the assistants themselves, since they’re also given limited options to even help me out in the first place. i’ve previously gotten a fully different order, and was rewarded with a wolt token (free delivery wow) and maybe half of the money i paid originally. these issues with customer service have really made me rethink my patronage to wolt, and with all kinds of new delivery apps popping up that don’t have these issues i think it’s time to switch.",3,False,Keizer 1098345,"great app, horrible customer service.",Wolt

I want to give tips based on provided services and it can only be after service was done, so I can decide give no give and how much I want to give. secondly will be outstanding to see on main screen ratings you have given previously to restaurants, thankfully variety is big and for such heavy user who order sometimes several times a day it is impossible to remember feedbacks I have previously given. I had cases where I had negative experience with restaurant and them several months later again placed order and had to face with same issues, if I had a hit on my previous feedback this could have saved me from having another negative experience. if these two functions will be implemented then I can all this best available app for food ordering! hope developers pay attention on this",3,False,fmammadov,good app but missing crucial optionality,Wolt

Customer service is not equipped with the tools or knowledge to solve the technical issues you’re likely to experience in this app. For example, I received German Wolt promo credits while in Serbia? Doesn’t make sense right? Instead of attempting to solve the problem many customer service agents chose to educate me on how currency exchange works. First, we’re talking about Wolt credits not money. Second, why would Wolt issue credits for a country you’re not in? After reaching out on Twitter, email support, wolt in-app support no one offered a solution. Eventually I figured out there’s an app setting that determines what country the promo codes will be generated for. Mine was oddly set to Germany. I changed it to Serbia. No one offered this which makes me question if employees actually use the app? Is this all designed for people who travel and use wolt globally? After my personal experiences I concluded it’s not.

The app initially promised a 30-minute delivery estimate, but after waiting for a whopping 90 minutes with no sign of my order being picked up, I decided to cancel.

However, the trouble didn't end there. Canceling my order was an uphill battle, as the customer support initially refused to comply with my request. I had to plead with them before they finally agreed to cancel the order. To add insult to injury, just minutes before the cancellation, the estimated time suddenly jumped to another 220 minutes, which is utterly unacceptable.

This entire ordeal left me feeling frustrated and extremely dissatisfied with Wolt's service. It's disheartening to encounter such a lack of responsibility and professionalism in a delivery app. I hope they take this feedback seriously and work on improving their customer service and delivery efficiency.

2023-08-04 17:22:07,"Unreliable Service and Appalling Customer Support - Wolt's Epic Fail!

I cannot express my frustration enough with the abysmal experience I've had with Wolt. This review serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering using this app for their food delivery needs. If you value your time, sanity, and hunger, steer clear of Wolt like the plague!

Picture this: you're hungry, eagerly anticipating a delicious meal that you've ordered through Wolt. The estimated delivery time was reasonable, and you were patient at first. But, lo and behold, 45 minutes have passed since the promised delivery time, and your stomach is growling louder than a freight train! 

The irony is painful. The Wolt app's status still shows the delivery as ""on its way,"" even though you're seriously beginning to question if your food is being transported via a tortoise. Not to mention the incessant false advertising of their ""under 2 minutes"" customer service response time – it's been a whopping 15 minutes and still no sign of life from their end.

Let's talk about customer support. Or should I say, the lack thereof? Sending messages into the abyss of their chat function is like shouting into a black hole; your cries for help disappear without a trace. It's as if Wolt has hired invisible robots to man their customer service lines. And oh, the frustration when you receive an automated response, assuring you that you'll get a reply in ""under 2 minutes."" Well, Wolt, let me assure you, those two minutes stretch into eternity when you're left staring at your screen, praying for a human to acknowledge your existence.

What's truly baffling is how Wolt can have the audacity to charge premium prices for their services while delivering (or not delivering, in this case) such subpar experiences. If my order is going to be 45 minutes late, I at least expect some transparency – a notification, an apology, a carrier pigeon with an update – anything!

This ordeal has taught me that Wolt has zero respect for its customers' time and well-being. They seem to think it's acceptable to keep hungry patrons waiting indefinitely, with zero accountability or remorse. I'm left wondering if anyone at Wolt has ever experienced hunger or frustration themselves, because they clearly have no empathy for their paying customers.

In conclusion, my advice is simple: save yourself the headache, the hunger, and the disappointment. Avoid Wolt like a plague-ridden rat. If you value your time and sanity, opt for a food delivery service that respects you as a customer, values your time, and actually provides reliable support. Wolt, consider this review a parting gift from a once-hopeful customer – a testament to your failure in delivering on your promises and a reminder that your competition is just a click away.",1,False,T Corp W.W,Unreliable Service and Appalling Customer Support - Wolt's Epic Fail!,Wolt
