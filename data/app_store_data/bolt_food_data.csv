2022-10-20 17:08:18,"Being single and traveling a lot for work, all around the world - I have used quite a number of delivery services and apps. I must say Bolt Food in Malta is probably the best one so far. I had a good experience with some apps in California - but in smaller cites, like here in Malta - nothing I’ve tried comes even close! In fact this applies to the whole Bolt app selection here, the scooters and taxi as well. Just a joy to use. Highly and unreservedly recommend.

*edit - I didn’t remember having left a review. I can only confirm it. If they have been mistakes (1 in 100) everything is corrected instantly in a polite and respectful manner.

Sure, opting to not store it is an option, but then it becomes *very* tedious to re-enter the info every time I order. Apple Pay effectively solves this, and it’s more secure for the purchaser. Your competitor has this, so you should definitely consider adding it soon. 😉",4,False,henhouse,"Nice app, but lacking Apple Pay",Bolt Food

I made a card payment, which was debited from my account and cleared on the app, but it later came back as negative. Despite escalating the issue to the customer service team, all they keep telling me is to use my card again and they will debit it and credit me. This doesn't make any sense to me because I have already made the payment and I shouldn't have to pay double for something I have already paid for. I provided evidence of payment, but the situation remains unresolved. To make matters worse, I am now unable to access the app, and I can still see a negative balance on the ride app. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed immediately.

I ended up driving to the restaurant and learnt that the Bolt platform allows drivers to cancel the order, once they have collected it.  Our delivery man was waiting for our order, whilst someone else as per the security footage, already collected our food.

As Bolt refunded as on the app, the restaurant had to remake our order which I paid for with the waiter.

You’ve convinced me now (twice already in less than a week) that your app is worthless in the current conditions. I would like to emphasise this is NOT a restaurant or courrier issue, but an app issue. 

Not only did both orders arrive significantly late vs. the time communicated initially, but in both cases the food arrived barely warm, and the fact that you provide a free delivery does not help at all.

Can’t communicate directly with restaurants easily (it’s nested deeply in some support view).

The only way to leave feedback is with a negative review which hurts the business when a simple chat with them would often suffice.

Super unethical that they haven’t invested in fixing the issues which squeeze the restaurants and couriers. It’s trash.

Use Wolt until these issues are fixed.

 And since the support team doesn’t want to change a previous review in their DB for a restaurant on my behalf that had to be negative just to get a word across to them about an order, we can just leave this here until the issues with their app are resolved and they start respecting the small businesses and independent contractors who work their butt off to make this app possible.",1,False,Comwiz,Doesn’t let you leave tips.
